       	  <h3>Athletics</h3>
        	<p>The Hawks football team has records of excellence and this year made it to state (I think). Hancock has also had the privelige of being the home of famed football player Brett Favre. </p><br>
        	
            <h3>Pride of Hancock</h3>
        	<p>The Pride of Hancock is the Hawk's marching band as well as concert/symphonic band. They compete in competitions on the coast of Mississippi and recently made a trip to Canton to be in a parade with Brett Favre.</p>
